### Hi! I'm Marius Müller.

I'm a Mathematics and computer science student at WWU Münster.

On here I'll occasionally pubish some projects I'm working on from univesity.
My primary languages are Haskell and Java.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via E-Mail (see linktree), preferably in English or German.
